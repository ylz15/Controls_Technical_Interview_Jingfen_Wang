Exo Controller - Part 2 (4 hours)

Your team is designing an ExoBoot controller to augment someone while they’re walking. 
Given the data from the sensors on the exo, which include a 6-axis IMU located on the calf, 
an encoder located on the ankle, a motor encoder, and a current and voltage reading from 
the motor, the goal is to determine what commands to send to the motor. Hopefully, those 
commands will result in a helpful amount of torque when a user is walking, but will not 
hinder the user in any way when the user is doing other motions. 

One of the controls engineers on your team has figured out a way to send the appropriate 
motor commands given a desired ankle torque, so now all you have to do is determine how 
much torque to output at the ankle at any given point in time (keep in mind, the exo can 
only apply positive ankle torques, which move the ankle joint in the plantarflexion direction, 
and a zero ankle torque would allow the ankle joint to move freely). Thankfully, another 
controls engineer on the team found a useful dataset online that reports ideal torque at 
the ankle joint of an ankle exo very similar to the exoboot and includes data from different 
users and movements. 

With all this information you start brainstorming ways to recreate those ankle torques on 
the ExoBoot and you have a lot of questions: Based on this dataset, how might we calculate how 
much ankle torque our user's prefer during each part of their step? Can we use gait phase 
(when the foot is on the ground vs when it isn’t) to understand how/when to go from zero torque 
to peak torque? Can we predict when users are going uphill and use that to understand how/when/what 
the peak torque should be? Can we detect when a user is not walking so that we make sure the 
exo doesn’t hinder those movements?

You know you can’t prototype solutions for all your questions, but want to see if you can address 
one of them and show your team a quick proof of concept so you can decide how to move forward 
with the project.

Side note: In your attempts to make a proof of concept, you enlist a junior software engineer 
to make some quick helper functions for you. You get the helper functions back from them and 
notice that they’re functional, but could be implemented better. You decide to use this as a 
teaching moment and provide a code review for your coworker.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Candidate Action Items:

1. Given the provided datasets, create a basic implementation for 1 of the following functions: 
	- predictAnkleTorque
	- detectWalking
	- isUserInStance
	- calculateGroundSlope
   Keep in mind that the ultimate goal would be to try your implementation out in real time, 
   on a real device, on a real human.

2. Review the file of helper functions. Within the file, implement changes that would improve 
   the quality of the file.

3. Please fill out the following:

	Did you implement Task 1 in Matlab or Python? _______________________

	Which function did you choose to implement for Task 1? __________________________
	Briefly describe your implementation (1-3 sentences).

	Briefly describe your improvements to the file of helper functions.

Rules of Engagement:

0. We don't expect you to spend more than 4 hours working on this technical challenge. Do what you can 
   in that time. If you want to work more feel free, but please push your final solution within 24 hours 
   of receiving this task, as that is when we will pull your branch and evaluate your solution.
1. You may implement your solution for Task 1 in either Matlab or Python. 
2. If you choose to implement in Python, you may only use the following non-standard libraries:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
		(if matplotlib doesn't work because of a kiwisolver error, try uninstalling and reinstalling kiwisolver)
	- scipy
	- if necessary you can use simple standard libaries like (os, sys, math, copy, etc) 
3. If you choose to implement in Matlab, DO NOT use any functions from non-standard toolboxes or add-ons.
4. Which function you choose to implement will dictate which folder of the repo you work in. However, 
   each folder contains the following files/folders:
	- dataset: a folder containing csv files of data collected from people using the exo. You can 
	  use this folder to make/self-test your implementaion. Note: The dataset we use to evaluate 
	  your implementation may contain a few additional files that you do not have access too.
	- functionName: this is the file where you will implement your function
	- exampleFunctionNameFunction: provides an example of what the output of your function 
	  implementation may look like
	- testFunctionNameFunction: provides a way for you to test your function implementation on the 
          files in the dataset folder
5. If you create additional code to help you analyze data or otherwise help you implement your function, 
   put them in 1 or more additional files within the function's folder. Don't forget; we are interested 
   in both your solution and your thought process.

Some biomechanics notes:

1. There are multiple ways to solve these tasks and you DO NOT need any biomechanics background to 
   solve any of them, so if that's not you're background or approach, that's okay. In case it's useful, 
   we've defined a couple of terms below:
	- Heelstrike: when your heel hits the ground at the beginning of a step
	- Stance: the phase of the step in which your foot is on the ground
	- Swing: the phase of the step in which your foot is in the air
	- Step: the movement from heelstrike to heelstrike on the SAME foot

2. For those WITH biomechanics background, please take note of the following, because our conventions 
   are likely different than what you learned:
	- A single step starts at heelstrike and ends when that SAME foot heelstrikes again
	- Positive ankle velocities correspond to plantarflexion. Negative ankle velocities correspond 
	  to dorsiflexion.

A few more useful details:

The datasets provided are different for each problem and include a variety of files that correspond to 
different users completing different movements, such as walking, running, going upstairs, and going 
downstairs. Each csv in the dataset, sampled at 100 Hz,  lists a variety of variables, including but 
not limited to:

accelx, accely, accelz		acceleration from IMU		bits			2048 bits/(m/s^2)

											of the angle between your 
											calf and your foot.
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
ank_vel				ankle angular velocity 		10 x (degrees/s)	Positive values correspond
				estimate calculated from 				to plantarflexion. Negative
				ank_ang							values correspond to dorsiflexion.

											4 = downstairs
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
gait_state 			Describes whether the user 	N/A			<0 = unknown
				is in stance or swing 					0 = swing
											1 = stance

				time since the step began)

				ground speed
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
incline 			Rough estimate of a the 	% grade 		Positive values correspond to a
