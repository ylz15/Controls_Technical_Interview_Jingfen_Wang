'''
Implement the following function
Description:
Predicts the slope of the ground as a % grade

Input:
data_array >> an N x M numpy array of variables collected from a single user
while doing a single movement for multiple steps (i.e. 10 walking steps, 
10 running steps, etc).

Output:
groundSlopePredictions >> an N x 1 array, where each element in the array
represents the % grade of the ground the user is currently moving over
(i.e. the method should be a rough prediction of the value of 
data_array[n,hf.variable_name_to_column_index('incline')], 
though hopefully your prediction is much better than ours)

	# This is a placeholder so the code will run. Replace this with your
	# implementation.
	groundSlopePredictions = deepcopy(data_array[:,hf.variable_name_to_column_index('incline')])
	return groundSlopePredictions
